Microsmt pnpboard v1.7        (2022/10/25)

1: Please check whether the radiator of the drive module contacts the pin.
2: Please use 24V voltage and DC current with rated current above 15A. The 24V DC input has reverse connection protection. If you connect the positive and negative poles reversely, adjust them correctly.
3: The  TMC2209‘s driver current can be adjusted only when 24V power supply is used. 
4：The  TMC2209‘s   factory setting  is a 32 step subdivision. If you want to modify it, please refer to the manual of the TMC2209 drive module. 
4: Rotate the potentiometer on the  TMC2209‘s  drive module with a screwdriver to change the reference voltage and adjust the output current,  I=Vref. At this time, the driver is not allowed to connect to the motor.
5:If you use a microsmt pnpV3 machine, please adjust the current of the  TMC2209‘s drive module as follows: X axis 1.6A, Y axis 1.7A, Z axis 1.3A, N1 axis 0.4A, N2 axis 0.4A.
6: LED 2 and LED 3 flash alternately, indicating that the mainboard is working normally.
7: When pressing the emergency stop switch, all of  stepper motors will stop.
8: Please first connect the motherboard to the computer with a USB cable, carefully study the configuration text in the SD card, and then try to debug the machine.
9: Please download the instruction document from this website.   https://github.com/microsmt/Microsmt-PNP-hardware
10: Please email me if you have any questions   bingluo@microsmt.com.cn.
11: This motherboard  is warranted for 1 year in case of non man-made damage.

12: Press RESET or power on again, the config  file  will be loaded into the  motherboard.    The motherboard can work normally only when there is a config file in the SD card.
13: If you use a microsmt PNPV3 machine, you can directly copy the machine file to the directory of openpnp2, overwrite the original file, so you don't have to learn how to configure openpnp from    the beginning
14：Openpnp only needs to configure endstop min, not  need  endstop max. All endstop signals are active at  high  level.
     Therefore, the X Y axis  uses Omron's SS-5GL switch to trigger the  high level. that is, pin 2 and pin 3 of the  Xmin and Ymin  are normally closed to keep low level,when reaching the endstop position, SS-5GL becomes open circuit, pin 2 becomes high level, and endstop action is triggered.
     The Z-axis uses Omron's EE-SX672 photoelectric switch to trigger the high level,You need to query the schematic diagrams of pnpboard v1.7 and EE-SX672 to understand the connection of the four pins of EE-SX672.   First connect the positive and negative poles of EE-SX672 to pin 1 and pin 2 of Zmin . Connect OUT to pin 3 of Zmin . Then short-circuit the positive pole of EE-SX672 and the L pin. This connection mode will enable the OUT pin to output low level when there is light and high level when there is no light, thus triggering Zmin endstop.

15: For users of microsmt pnpV3 machine, you can copy the machine.xml   file to the. openpn2 directory on disk C to overwrite the original file, so that you can run the pnpV3 machine directly. This machine.xml  file is  generated from the   2021-06-30_ 19_ 21_ 07  version of openpnp software. If you want to use the latest version of openpnp software, you may need to reset some parameters. However, I suggest that you try to configure the machine from scratch according to the official instructions of openpnp, so as to have a better understanding of openpnp.
