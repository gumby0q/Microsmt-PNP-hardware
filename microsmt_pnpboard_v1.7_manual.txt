Microsmt pnpboard v1.7

1: Please check whether the radiator of the drive module contacts the pin.
2: Please use 24V voltage and DC current with rated current above 15A.
3: The driver current can be adjusted only when 24V power supply is used.
4: Rotate the potentiometer on the drive module with a screwdriver to change the reference voltage and adjust the output current,  I=Vref. At this time, the driver is not allowed to connect to the motor.
5: LED 2 and LED 3 flash alternately, indicating that the mainboard is working normally.
6: When pressing the emergency stop switch, the machine will stop.
7: Please first connect the motherboard to the computer with a USB cable, carefully study the configuration text in the SD card, and then try to debug the machine.
8: Please download the instruction document from this website.   https://github.com/microsmt/Microsmt-PNP-hardware
9: Please email me if you have any questions   bingluo@microsmt.com.cn.
10: This motherboard  is warranted for 1 year in case of non man-made damage.

11: Press RESET or power on again, the config  file  will be loaded into the  motherboard.    The motherboard can work normally only when there is a config file in the SD card.
12: If you use a microsmt PNPV3 machine, you can directly copy the machine file to the directory of openpnp2, overwrite the original file, so you don't have to learn how to configure openpnp from the beginning
13ï¼šOpenpnp only needs to configure endstop min, not endstop max. All endstop signals are active at low level, Therefore, the X Y axis usually uses OMRON's SS-5GL switch to trigger the low level. that is, pin 2 and pin 3 of the endstop are short circuited. The Z-axis uses Omron's EE-SX672 photoelectric switch to trigger the low level,You need to query the schematic diagrams of pnpboard v1.7 and EE-SX672 to understand the connection of the four pins of EE-SX672.
